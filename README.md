## From goal to delivery

- **Delegate in parallel**: create tasks across projects, choose agents, and move several pieces of work forward together.
- **Follow up in one place**: track execution, continue conversations, grant permissions, and adjust direction when needed.
- **Review and deliver**: inspect code diffs, request changes, then merge or push separate branches after review.

Explore apps, schedules, workflows, and more on the [website](https://caravel-site.pages.dev/?lang=en#possibilities), or [try them in the demo](https://caravel-site.pages.dev/demo/?lang=en).

## Get started

1. [Download the installer](https://github.com/yy36295238/caravel-releases/releases/latest). On macOS, open the `.dmg` and drag **Caravel** into Applications. On Windows x64, download and run `Caravel_*_x64-setup.exe`.
2. Prepare Git and at least one supported agent CLI, installed and signed in or configured.
3. Add a local project, create a task, choose an agent, and start the run.

Both platforms provide the complete Caravel app with all feature modules. macOS supports in-app updates; on Windows, download and run the new installer to update. Windows requires Git for Windows, Node.js, and an agent CLI. The Windows installer is not yet signed: if SmartScreen appears, verify that it came from this repository’s Releases, then choose “More info → Run anyway”. Tasks and conversations stay on your machine; online model calls and external integrations still use the network.

<summary><strong>First launch blocked on macOS? Use Open Anyway or Terminal</strong></summary>

The public macOS app is not yet signed with an Apple Developer ID or notarized. Verify that the installer came from this repository’s Releases and move Caravel into Applications, then use either option below.

**Option 1: Allow the app in System Settings**

1. Try opening Caravel once to trigger the macOS warning.
2. Open “System Settings → Privacy & Security”, find the notice about Caravel, and click “Open Anyway”.
3. Enter your Mac login password or use Touch ID, then click “Open”. Button wording may vary by macOS version.

**Option 2: Use Terminal**

Open Terminal on your Mac, run this command, and reopen Caravel:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Caravel.app
```

This command only removes Caravel’s download quarantine attribute. See the [installation help](https://caravel-site.pages.dev/?lang=en#install-help) for more details.
